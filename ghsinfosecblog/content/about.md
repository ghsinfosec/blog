Hi :wave:, I'm Heath aka ghsinfosec. I didn't start getting serious about cybersecurity until I was about 32. It all started with a YouTube video by a guy named John Hammond. You may have heard of him :smirk: ... After a few years of consistent failure I could *almost* be a mediocre ~~hacker~~ security researcher, an occasional CTF player, and I find myself jumping down rabbit holes probably more often than I care to admit. There's always something to learn and I hope you learn something here!

Outside of that I have an amazing wife, a wonderful little boy, and a spunky dog who keeps us entertained.
