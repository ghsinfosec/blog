Hi :wave:, I'm Heath aka ghsinfosec. I didn't start getting serious about cybersecurity until I was about 32. It all started with a YouTube video by a guy named John Hammond. You may have heard of him :smirk: ... After a few years of consistent failure I could *almost* consider myself a mediocre ~~hacker~~ security researcher, occasional CTF player, and I find myself jumping down rabbit holes probably more often than I care to admit. There's always something to learn and I hope you learn something here!

Outside of that I have an amazing wife, a wonderful little boy, and a spunky dog who keeps us entertained.

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ghsinfosec) that I cringe about now and haven't posted a video in a long time. It's full of skill issues and I'm not shilling it for subs, but I don't mind sharing it because for me it's a reminder of where I started and how far I've come. Maybe someday I'll get some better content on there but for now I'll stick to the blog, who knows... :man_shrugging:
